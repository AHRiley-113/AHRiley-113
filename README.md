- 👋 Hi, I’m @AHRiley-113
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the fundamentals of computer science so that I may understand how the tech around me works. I have always wondered, but wondering isn't good enough.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Harvard cs50 course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing... yet.
